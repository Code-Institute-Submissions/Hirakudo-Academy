**Code Institute - Milestone Project for Interactive Frontend Development**

This project is the second Milestone Project that make up the Full Stack Developer course at the Code Institute. 

The project purpose is to build an interactive front-end site. The site should respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals through the main use of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## User Experience

The website is a tribute to my aikido master, where the users can find information on him, the days when he has lessons and a memory game to learn and repeat the main techniques.
